# 💼 Open to work

I am currently looking for ***entry-level*** roles in software engineering.

I am familiar with [Rust](https://rust-lang.org), [Python](https://python.org) and [Julia](https://julialang.org).

My interests are distributing and packaging software, and software automation to easily
accomplish tasks. I am also familiar with writing RPM specfiles. 😄
