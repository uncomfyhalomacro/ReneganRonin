# ⏫ Soc Virnyl S. Estela

I have a passion for technology and biology, hoping to build a career both
as a bioinformatician, a technologist and a software engineer.

As a science instructor at a private university, I teach biology courses to
undergraduate students, using interactive and engaging methods to foster
their curiosity and passion for science.

I am a proud member of the openSUSE community, where I maintain 22+ packages
that include tools for my organization. I have been involved in open source
software development since 2020, starting with Debian as my first Linux
distribution. I believe in the spirit of open source and its potential to
advance scientific discovery and innovation. My goal is to pursue a career in
software development and engineering or bioinformatics, where I can combine
my expertise in microbiology and programming to solve real-world problems.

I also post blogs sometimes at [my website](https://uncomfyhalomacro.pl).

# 💼 Open to work

I am currently looking for ***entry-level*** roles in software engineering.

I am also open for other roles such as IT related:
- Systems Administration
- Software Advocate
- Software Technologist

Since it is *entry-level*, I hope I get the necessary and sufficient training
to undertake my assigned role. 🫂

I am familiar with [Rust](https://rust-lang.org), [Python](https://python.org)
and [Julia](https://julialang.org).

My interests are distributing and packaging software, and software automation
to easily accomplish tasks. I am also familiar with writing RPM specfiles. 😄
