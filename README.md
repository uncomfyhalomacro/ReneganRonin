# ⏫ Soc Virnyl S. Estela

I have a passion for technology and biology, hoping to build a career in
software engineering in various fields.

I am a proud member of the openSUSE community, where I maintain 22+ packages
that include tools for my organization. I have been involved in open source
software development since 2020, starting with Debian as my first Linux
distribution. I believe in the spirit of open source and its potential to
advance scientific discovery and innovation. My goal is to pursue a career in
software development and engineering or bioinformatics, where I can combine
my expertise in microbiology and programming to solve real-world problems.

I also post blogs sometimes at [my website](https://uncomfyhalomacro.pl).
