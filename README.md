I am also in the following forges:

- https://codeberg.org/uncomfyhalomacro
- https://git.sr.ht/~uncomfy
- https://git.sr.ht/~uncomfyhalomacro ‚Üê i accidentally deleted my key for this before i can backup. üòï

## Note 

I do not use GitHub anymore for hosting some of my projects because of the GitHub Copilot controversy. I mainly use Codeberg to host my projects.
I do still use it for existing projects that I have collaborated before and/or possibly, for job related projects so feel free to go there.
